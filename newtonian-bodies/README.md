# Newtonean Bodies

A command line prgram that simulates the behavoir of multiple modies under newtonian mechanis. You specify the initial conditions for those bodies and then we solve the differential equations dervided from Newton's Laws. You get a parquet file with the results of the simmulation, which you then can use to visualize the results in another tool.
